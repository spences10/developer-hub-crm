# Developer-Focused CRM Guide

## Overview

The Developer Hub CRM is specially designed for software developers,
engineers, and tech professionals to manage their professional
networks, relationships, and opportunities in a way that aligns with
the unique needs of the tech industry.

Unlike generic CRMs, this application focuses on the specific
relationship management needs of developers, including technical
networking, job opportunities, knowledge sharing, and professional
growth.

  technologies they work with (e.g., React, Python, Cloud).

   information and follow up on pending interactions.
4. **Link to Projects**: Connect contacts to specific projects or
   collaborations for context.

  table
- Extended profile information for VIPs in the background and
  contact_info tables
- Status tracking through the `status` field in the contacts table
