# Product Vision: Dev Hub CRM

## Current State Assessment

### Reality Check (October 2025)

**Database Stats:**

- 17 contacts (realistic developer personas)
- 32 interactions (meetings, calls, emails)
- 17 follow-ups (completed, overdue, upcoming)
- 1 active user
- 3 VIP relationships tracked

**What We Have Built:**

- ✅ Solid CRM foundation (contacts, interactions, follow-ups)
- ✅ Clean tech stack (Svelte 5, SQLite, Better Auth)
- ✅ One developer feature (GitHub Quick Connect)
- ✅ Polish (themes, preferences, search, VIP tracking)
- ✅ Quality code (validation, auth, tests)

**Current Rating: 6/10**

We've built a **competent CRM** that works. The code is solid, UX is
clean, data model makes sense. But it's functionally a generic CRM
with one dev feature.

### The Brutal Truth

**Why developers won't care (yet):**

- Everything is manual (every interaction logged by hand)
- GitHub import is cool for first contact, then what?
- No integration with developer workflows
- No automation or intelligence
- Relationships live in GitHub activity, not in forms

**Competing with:**

- Notion/Airtable (more flexible, AI features)
- Spreadsheets (free, simple)
- Memory + GitHub activity (already there)

**The only way we win:** Save developers **significant time** through
automation or provide **unique insights** they can't get elsewhere.

## The Vision: 9/10 Developer CRM

### Core Problem We're Solving

Developers are terrible at relationship management because:

1. **They hate manual data entry** - Want it automated
2. **They live in specific tools** - Terminal, GitHub, IDE
3. **Their networks are unique** - Based on code, not sales calls
4. **They value privacy** - Want to own their data
5. **They network differently** - Open source, conferences, GitHub

### Unique Value Proposition

**"The CRM that works like a developer"**

**Free Tier:**

- CRM that speaks developer (GitHub, CLI, self-hosted)
- Zero lock-in (SQLite, full export, own your data)
- Works offline, privacy-first

**Paid Tier:**

- Automates relationship management (90% less manual work)
- Provides unique insights (GitHub activity intelligence)
- Meets developers where they are (terminal, webhooks, API)

### What Makes This Different

**Not another CRM with GitHub integration.** **A relationship
intelligence platform for developers.**

- **Auto-tracks** GitHub activity (releases, stars, collaborations)
- **Auto-suggests** actions ("Sarah released v2.0 → send congrats")
- **Auto-enriches** contacts from public developer activity
- **CLI-first** (log interactions without leaving terminal)
- **AI-powered** (agents that analyze and recommend)
- **Network effects** (every user is a growth channel via public
  profiles)

## Target Users

### Primary: Individual Developers

**Personas:**

1. **Conference Networker** - Attends 5-10 events/year, meets 100+
   devs
2. **Open Source Maintainer** - Manages contributor relationships
3. **Developer Advocate** - Tracks community relationships
   professionally
4. **Freelance Dev** - Manages client relationships + dev network
5. **Job Seeker** - Networking for opportunities, referrals

**Pain Points:**

- "I met 50 people at SvelteConf, now have 50 business cards I'll
  never follow up with"
- "I want to know when people in my network ship something cool"
- "I forget to stay in touch with people who could help my career"
- "Current CRMs feel like sales tools, not for developers"

### Secondary: Developer Teams

**Personas:**

1. **Dev Relations Teams** - Manage community relationships
2. **Startup Founders** - Technical networking, hiring, partnerships
3. **Engineering Managers** - Track industry connections, hiring
   pipeline

**Pain Points:**

- "We need to track conference leads as a team"
- "Want to monitor our open source community health"
- "Need shared context on developer relationships"

## Success Metrics

### User Acquisition

- Month 1-3: 100 signups (friends, Twitter, Product Hunt)
- Month 4-6: 1,000 signups (viral growth from public profiles)
- Month 7-12: 10,000 signups (conference season, word of mouth)

### Engagement

- 40% weekly active (check dashboard, log interactions)
- 60% use CLI tool weekly
- 30% share their public profile QR at events

### Monetization

- 10% convert to paid within 30 days
- Average LTV: $200 (12 months \* $15-20)
- Churn <5% monthly

### Viral Coefficient

- Each user shares profile → 2-3 signups
- QR scans at conferences → 60% conversion
- Network effect: more users = more value

## Competitive Differentiation

### vs. Traditional CRMs (Salesforce, HubSpot)

- ❌ They're for sales teams, not developers
- ✅ We're CLI-first, GitHub-native, self-hosted

### vs. Notion/Airtable

- ❌ They're generic, require manual work
- ✅ We auto-sync GitHub, suggest actions, AI agents

### vs. LinkedIn

- ❌ LinkedIn is passive networking
- ✅ We're active relationship management with developer context

### vs. Spreadsheets

- ❌ Spreadsheets are manual, no intelligence
- ✅ We automate data entry, provide insights, track activity

## Strategic Moats

1. **GitHub Integration Depth** - Deepest GitHub CRM integration in
   market
2. **Developer-First Design** - CLI, self-hosted, API-first (not an
   afterthought)
3. **Network Effects** - Every user's public profile drives growth
4. **Data Ownership** - SQLite + full export = trust from
   privacy-conscious devs
5. **AI Agents** - Proactive relationship management (not just
   storage)

## Key Risks & Mitigation

### Risk: "Nice toy, won't use daily"

**Mitigation:** Make it effortless

- CLI tool (use without opening browser)
- GitHub auto-sync (works while you sleep)
- Daily digest (brings value to you)

### Risk: "GitHub rate limits"

**Mitigation:** Smart caching & batching

- Cache aggressively
- Batch API calls
- Tier limits (free = 10/day, paid = unlimited)

### Risk: "Privacy concerns with AI"

**Mitigation:** Transparency & control

- Option to self-host with OSS models
- Never share data with third parties
- Clear privacy policy
- User controls what's tracked

### Risk: "Viral growth doesn't work"

**Mitigation:** Multiple growth channels

- Public profiles (primary)
- Product Hunt, HN, Reddit (secondary)
- Conference sponsorships (if budget allows)
- Open source (organic GitHub discovery)

## Roadmap Philosophy

### Phase 1: Build Trust (Months 1-3)

- Deliver core CRM excellence
- Perfect GitHub integration
- Launch CLI tool
- Open source core **Goal:** 100 daily active users who love it

### Phase 2: Add Intelligence (Months 4-6)

- AI features (summarization, enrichment)
- Auto-sync GitHub activity
- Daily digest & suggestions **Goal:** 10% paid conversion,
  retention >90%

### Phase 3: Go Viral (Months 7-9)

- Public profiles + QR codes
- Conference marketing
- Network effects kick in **Goal:** 10,000 users, viral
  coefficient >1.5

### Phase 4: Scale (Months 10-12)

- AI agents (premium tier)
- Team features
- Advanced analytics **Goal:** $50k MRR, sustainable growth

## North Star Metric

**"Time saved through automation"**

Success = Developers spend <5 min/week managing relationships but
maintain stronger networks than ever.

Every feature should either:

1. Reduce manual work (automation)
2. Increase insight (intelligence)
3. Drive growth (viral mechanics)

If it doesn't do one of these, cut it.
