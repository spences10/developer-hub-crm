# AI Features

## Overview

AI transforms Devhub from passive storage into active relationship
intelligence. The foundation is vector search (essentially free), with
LLM calls for premium features (expensive, so paid tier only).

**Philosophy:** AI suggests, never decides. All outputs are reviewed
by user before action.

## Foundation: Vector Search (Free Tier)

See [vector-search.md](./vector-search.md) for technical details.

**What it enables:**

- Semantic contact search ("find rust developers" matches "systems
  programming")
- Smart context for AI features (only send relevant data to LLM)
- Similar contact discovery
- Topic clustering

**Cost:** ~$0.0001/user/month (Voyage AI embeddings)

## AI Feature Tiers

### Free Tier - Vector Search Only

No LLM calls, just semantic search powered by embeddings:

- Semantic contact search
- Relationship health score (rule-based algorithm)
- Basic suggestions (time-based reminders)

**Cost:** $0.001/user/month | **Revenue:** $0 (acquisition/retention
tool)

### Pro Tier ($15/mo) - AI Analysis

Limited LLM calls for one-off tasks:

- AI interaction summarization (100/month)
- AI suggested topics for follow-ups
- AI contact enrichment (on-demand)
- Enhanced relationship health (pattern analysis)

**Cost:** ~$8/user/month | **Revenue:** $15/mo | **Margin:**
$7/user/month

### Premium Tier ($40/mo) - AI Agents

Continuous AI processing with daily reports:

- Daily AI digest (automated)
- Relationship insights agent
- GitHub activity agent (if tracking enabled)
- Unlimited AI operations

**Cost:** ~$25/user/month | **Revenue:** $40/mo | **Margin:**
$15/user/month

## Free Tier Features

### 1. Semantic Contact Search

Find contacts by meaning, not keywords.

**Example queries:**

- "machine learning" ‚Üí finds "neural networks", "AI research", "LLM
  development"
- "rust developers" ‚Üí finds "systems programming", "performance
  optimization"
- "conference speakers" ‚Üí finds mentions of "talk", "presentation",
  "keynote"

**How:** Pure vector similarity search, no LLM needed.

**UX:** Toggle between "Keyword" and "Semantic" search modes on
contacts page.

### 2. Relationship Health Score

**Current:** Basic rule-based algorithm (time since contact,
interaction count, VIP status)

**Enhanced (Pro tier):** Pattern analysis detects typical cadence
("You contact Sarah every 6 weeks")

### 3. Time-Based Suggestions

Simple rule-based suggestions:

- "Haven't contacted in 90+ days"
- "Overdue follow-up"
- "VIP not contacted in 30 days"

## Pro Tier Features ($15/mo)

### 1. AI Interaction Summarization

**Use case:** Paste long email thread or meeting notes ‚Üí get
structured summary.

**Input:** Raw text (up to 4k tokens)

**Output:**

- Key points (3-5 bullets)
- Action items extracted
- Suggested follow-up tasks
- Topics discussed

**Limit:** 100/month

**UX:** Button on "Log Interaction" form: "‚ú® Summarize with AI"

### 2. AI Suggested Topics

**Use case:** Opening follow-up reminder ‚Üí see suggested talking
points.

**How it works:**

1. Vector search finds most relevant past interactions
2. LLM analyzes context + time since last contact
3. Generates 3-5 suggested topics

**Example:**

_"You last spoke with Sarah 3 months ago about:"_

- Svelte 5 migration project
- Her new role at Vercel
- Conference speaking

_"Suggested topics:"_

- Ask how the Svelte 5 launch went
- Congratulate on her recent blog post
- Check if she's speaking at upcoming conferences

**UX:** Auto-shown on follow-up reminder when >30 days since last
contact

### 3. AI Contact Enrichment

**Use case:** You have partial contact info, AI finds missing data.

**Input:** Name, company (optional), GitHub username (optional)

**Output:**

- Suggested company (if missing)
- Potential social links
- Bio/background summary
- Tech stack/interests

**How it works:**

1. Vector search similar contacts in your network
2. LLM analyzes patterns + public data hints
3. Returns suggestions with confidence scores

**UX:** Button on contact detail page: "‚ú® Enrich with AI"

### 4. Enhanced Relationship Health

**Analysis:**

- "You typically contact Sarah every 6 weeks"
- "Relationship strength: STRONG (consistent engagement)"
- "Suggested frequency: Every 4-6 weeks"

**How:** LLM analyzes interaction gaps to detect patterns.

## Premium Tier Features ($40/mo)
