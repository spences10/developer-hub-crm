# Growth Strategy

## Growth Channels (Prioritized)

### 1. Viral Growth via Public Profiles (PRIMARY)

**Mechanic:** Every user = growth channel. User creates profile, gets
QR, shares at conferences/Twitter/GitHub, others scan → sign up →
repeat.

**Viral coefficient target:** >1.5 (each user brings 1.5 new users
over 6 months)

**Conversion path:** Scan QR → See Profile → "Add to CRM" → GitHub
OAuth → Account Created

**Growth projection:**

- Month 1: 100 users
- Month 3: 500 users (from profile shares)
- Month 6: 2,500 users (viral loop)
- Month 12: 10,000+ users

### 2. Conference Strategy (SEASONAL)

**Before:** Create "Conference Pack" (printable QR cards, social
graphics), share on conference Slack/Discord

**During:** Users share profiles, network effect compounds

**After:** "Import conference leads" email, CSV import feature, bulk
follow-up workflows

**Target conferences:** SvelteConf, ViteConf (niche), React Summit,
Next.js Conf (large), GitHub Universe, local meetups

**Prioritize:** Speaking > Attendee sharing > Sponsorship ($5k-15k)

### 3. Product Hunt Launch

**When:** After Phase 1 complete (CLI + profiles)

**Pre-launch (2 weeks):** Build in public on Twitter, tease features,
collect email list, prepare assets

**Launch day:** Post at 12:01 AM PST, engage in comments, share on
Twitter/HN/Reddit

**Target:** Top 5 Product of the Day, 200-500 signups (best case:
1,000+)

### 4. Open Source / GitHub

**Open source:** Core CRM, CLI tool, self-hosting instructions, docs

**Keep closed:** AI features, cloud infrastructure, premium features

**Benefits:** Trust with developers, GitHub stars = social proof,
contributors = evangelists, SEO

**Promotion:** Twitter progress, r/selfhosted, r/opensource, Hacker
News "Show HN", DEV.to/Hashnode

**Target:** 1,000 GitHub stars by month 12

### 5. Content Marketing

**Channels:** Blog, Twitter (@devhubcrm), DEV.to/Hashnode (syndicate),
YouTube

**Content types:**

- Educational: "How to manage developer relationships", "Conference
  networking tips"
- Product updates: "We shipped [feature]", "Behind the scenes:
  building [feature]", weekly changelog
- Case studies: "How [Developer] uses Devhub", "Managing 500+
  contacts"

**SEO keywords:** "developer CRM", "GitHub CRM", "conference
networking tool", "developer relationship management"

**Goal:** 1,000 organic visits/month by month 6

### 6. Community Building

**Platforms:** Discord (community support), Twitter (announcements),
GitHub Discussions (feature requests)

**Activities:** Weekly office hours, feature voting, user showcases,
beta testing program

### 7. Partnerships & Integrations

**Partner with:** Conference organizers, developer communities (DEV,
Hashnode), dev tools (Zapier, n8n)

**Integrations:** Zapier ("Devhub + Slack"), Discord bot, Notion
import/export, Linear linking

## Growth Tactics Timeline

**Month 1-2:** Build public profiles + QR, launch Product Hunt, start
Twitter, 4 blog posts, open source core

**Month 3-4:** Launch Discord, first conference (speaking), case study
#1, weekly changelog, 100 GitHub stars

**Month 5-6:** Viral loop kicks in, conference season push, partner
integrations, 1,000 users

**Month 7-9:** AI features launch, Premium tier, more conferences,
influencer partnerships, 5,000 users

**Month 10-12:** Optimize conversion, reduce churn, Team features,
enterprise outreach, 10,000 users

## Metrics to Track

**Acquisition:** Signups (total, by source), viral coefficient, CAC,
profile scans → signups

**Activation:** % complete onboarding, % log first interaction, %
create public profile, % install CLI

**Retention:** DAU/WAU/MAU, churn rate, feature adoption

**Revenue:** Free → paid conversion, MRR/ARR, LTV, LTV:CAC ratio

**Referral:** Viral coefficient, % users with public profile, QR scans
per user, invites sent

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**Don't:** Buy ads (low ROI), cold email (spam), aggressive upsells,
fake social proof, pay for reviews

**Do:** Build in public, solve real problems, listen to users, ship
fast, be authentic

## Budget Allocation (Bootstrap)

**$0-500/month (Months 1-6):**

- Hosting: $50
- Domain: $15/year
- **Total: ~$100/month**

**$500-2,000/month (Months 7-12):**

- Hosting: $100
- Conference tickets: $500/event
- Tools (Sentry, analytics): $50
- Content: $200
- **Total: ~$1,000/month**

**No budget for:** Ads, sales team, PR agency

## Success Milestones

**Month 3:** 100 users, 10 paying customers, Product Hunt top 10,
first conference speaking slot

**Month 6:** 1,000 users, 100 paying customers ($1,500 MRR), viral
coefficient >1, 500 GitHub stars

**Month 12:** 10,000 users, 1,000 paying customers ($18k MRR),
sustainable growth (no paid ads), 1,000 GitHub stars

## Contingency Plans

**If viral loop doesn't work:** Double down on conferences, partner
with influencers, SEO content push, referral incentives

**If growth too slow:** Survey users, improve onboarding, add referral
bonuses, paid ads (last resort)

**If too much growth:** Hire support, scale infrastructure, add
waitlist, raise prices
