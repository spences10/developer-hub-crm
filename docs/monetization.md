## Churn Prevention

2. **Weekly digest:** Keep showing value
3. **Usage nudges:** "You haven't logged in 2 weeks"
4. **Seasonal:** Conference reminders
5. **Data lock-in:** More data = harder to leave

**Target Churn:**

- Free tier: 10-15%/month (acceptable)
- Pro tier: <5%/month
- Premium tier: <3%/month (agents are sticky)

## Recommendation

**Start with:** Freemium SaaS

- Generous free tier (build trust)
- Pro at $18/mo (GitHub automation)
- Premium at $35/mo (AI agents)
- Annual option (17% off)

**Why not Open Core (yet):**

- Harder to monetize initially
- Requires community building
- Better as phase 2 (after product-market fit)

**Path:**

1. **Months 1-6:** Freemium SaaS, validate pricing
2. **Months 7-12:** Add annual plans, optimize conversion
3. **Year 2:** Open source core (trust building), keep cloud paid
4. **Year 3:** Add Team tier, enterprise features

**Success = $50k MRR by month 12**
