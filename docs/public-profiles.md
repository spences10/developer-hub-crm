# Public Profiles & Viral Growth

## The Viral Loop

**Core Mechanic:** Every user becomes a growth channel through their
public developer profile.

**How It Works:**

1. User signs up â†’ gets public profile (`devhub.app/@username`)
2. Profile includes QR code for easy sharing
3. At conferences/meetups â†’ shows QR code instead of business card
4. Someone scans â†’ sees profile + "Add to Your DevHub CRM" button
5. They sign up â†’ get their own profile â†’ repeat

**Result:** Exponential growth through network effects.
