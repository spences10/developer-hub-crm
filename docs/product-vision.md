# Product Vision: Dev Hub CRM

## Current State (October 2025)

**Database:** 17 contacts, 32 interactions, 17 follow-ups, 3 VIPs

**What we've built:**

- ✅ Solid CRM foundation (contacts, interactions, follow-ups)
- ✅ Clean tech stack (Svelte 5, SQLite, Better Auth)
- ✅ GitHub Quick Connect
- ✅ Polish (themes, preferences, search, VIP tracking)
- ✅ Quality code (validation, auth)

**Current rating:** 6/10 - Competent CRM but functionally generic with
one dev feature

**Why developers won't care yet:**

- Everything is manual (every interaction logged by hand)
- GitHub import is cool once, then what?
- No integration with developer workflows
- No automation or intelligence

## Vision: 9/10 Developer CRM

**Core problem:** Developers are terrible at relationship management
because they hate manual data entry, live in specific tools (terminal,
GitHub, IDE), have unique networks based on code, value privacy, and
network differently (open source, conferences).

**UVP:** "The CRM that works like a developer"

**Free tier:** CRM that speaks developer (GitHub, CLI, self-hosted),
zero lock-in (SQLite, full export, own data), works offline,
privacy-first

**Paid tier:** Automates relationship management (90% less manual
work), provides unique insights (GitHub activity intelligence), meets
developers where they are (terminal, webhooks, API)

**Differentiation:** Not another CRM with GitHub integration. A
relationship intelligence platform for developers that auto-tracks
GitHub activity, auto-suggests actions, auto-enriches contacts from
public activity, is CLI-first, AI-powered, and has network effects via
public profiles.

## Target Users

**Primary: Individual Developers**

1. Conference Networker - Attends 5-10 events/year, meets 100+ devs
2. Open Source Maintainer - Manages contributor relationships
3. Developer Advocate - Tracks community relationships
4. Freelance Dev - Manages client relationships + dev network
5. Job Seeker - Networking for opportunities, referrals

**Secondary: Developer Teams**

1. Dev Relations Teams
2. Startup Founders
3. Engineering Managers

## Success Metrics

**Month 1-3:** 100 signups (friends, Twitter, Product Hunt) **Month
4-6:** 1,000 signups (viral growth from public profiles) **Month
7-12:** 10,000 signups (conference season, word of mouth)

**Engagement:**

- 40% weekly active
- 60% use CLI tool weekly
- 30% share public profile QR at events

**Monetization:**

- 10% convert to paid within 30 days
- Average LTV: $200 (12 months × $15-20)
- Churn <5% monthly

**Viral coefficient:** Each user shares profile → 2-3 signups, QR
scans at conferences → 60% conversion

## Competitive Differentiation

- **vs. Traditional CRMs:** They're for sales teams. We're CLI-first,
  GitHub-native, self-hosted
- **vs. Notion/Airtable:** They're generic, require manual work. We
  auto-sync GitHub, suggest actions, AI agents
- **vs. LinkedIn:** LinkedIn is passive. We're active relationship
  management with developer context
- **vs. Spreadsheets:** Spreadsheets are manual. We automate data
  entry, provide insights, track activity

## Strategic Moats

1. GitHub Integration Depth - Deepest GitHub CRM integration in market
2. Developer-First Design - CLI, self-hosted, API-first (not an
   afterthought)
3. Network Effects - Every user's public profile drives growth
4. Data Ownership - SQLite + full export = trust from
   privacy-conscious devs
5. AI Agents - Proactive relationship management (not just storage)

## Roadmap Philosophy

**Phase 1: Build Trust (Months 1-3)**

- Deliver core CRM excellence
- Perfect GitHub integration
- Launch CLI tool
- Open source core
- **Goal:** 100 daily active users who love it

**Phase 2: Add Intelligence (Months 4-6)**

- AI features (summarization, enrichment)
- Auto-sync GitHub activity
- Daily digest & suggestions
- **Goal:** 10% paid conversion, retention >90%

**Phase 3: Go Viral (Months 7-9)**

- Public profiles + QR codes
- Conference marketing
- Network effects kick in
- **Goal:** 10,000 users, viral coefficient >1.5

**Phase 4: Scale (Months 10-12)**

- AI agents (premium tier)
- Team features
- Advanced analytics
- **Goal:** $50k MRR, sustainable growth

## North Star Metric

**"Time saved through automation"**

Success = Developers spend <5 min/week managing relationships but
maintain stronger networks than ever.

Every feature should either:

1. Reduce manual work (automation)
2. Increase insight (intelligence)
3. Drive growth (viral mechanics)

If it doesn't do one of these, cut it.
