# Growth Strategy

## Growth Philosophy

**Principle:** Developers don't respond to traditional marketing. They
respond to:

1. Genuine utility (it solves a real problem)
2. Word of mouth (trusted recommendations)
3. Open source / transparency
4. Community building

**Anti-Pattern:** Avoid ads, cold outreach, aggressive sales tactics

## Growth Channels (Prioritized)

### 1. Viral Growth via Public Profiles ⭐ PRIMARY

**Mechanic:** Every user = growth channel

**How:**

- User creates profile (`@username`)
- Gets QR code
- Shares at conferences, Twitter bio, GitHub README
- Others scan → sign up → get profile → repeat

**Viral Coefficient Target:** >1.5

- Each user brings 1.5 new users over 6 months
- Exponential growth kicks in

**Conversion Path:**

```
Scan QR → See Profile → "Add to CRM" → GitHub OAuth → Account Created
```

**Why It Works:**

- Zero friction (one-click GitHub sign-in)
- Immediate value (contact added + profile created)
- Social proof (see who else uses it)
- Network effects (more users = more value)

**Growth Projection:**

- Month 1: 100 users
- Month 3: 500 users (from profile shares)
- Month 6: 2,500 users (viral loop)
- Month 12: 10,000+ users

---

### 2. Conference Strategy ⭐ SEASONAL

**Timing:** Conference season (Mar-Nov)

**Tactics:**

**Before Conferences:**

- Create "Conference Pack" for attendees
- Printable QR cards
- Social media graphics
- Share on conference Slack/Discord

**During Conferences:**

- Users share their profiles
- Network effect compounds
- "Everyone has a DevHub QR"

**After Conferences:**

- "Import your conference leads" email
- CSV import feature
- Bulk follow-up workflows
- Case studies from successful users

**Target Conferences:**

- SvelteConf, ViteConf (niche, engaged)
- React Summit, Next.js Conf (large, developer-heavy)
- GitHub Universe, All Things Open (community)
- Local meetups (grassroots)

**ROI:**

- 1 sponsor booth = $5k-15k
- 1 speaking slot = free + exposure
- Attendees sharing profiles = $0 + viral growth

**Prioritize:** Speaking > Attendee sharing > Sponsorship

---

### 3. Product Hunt Launch

**When:** After Phase 1 complete (CLI + profiles)

**Strategy:**

**Pre-Launch (2 weeks before):**

- Build in public on Twitter
- Tease features
- Collect email list
- Prepare assets (video demo, screenshots)

**Launch Day:**

- Post at 12:01 AM PST
- Engage in comments all day
- Share on Twitter, HN, Reddit
- Ask friends to upvote (ethical)

**Post-Launch:**

- Follow up with upvoters
- Convert interest → signups
- Feature in email sequence

**Target:** Top 5 Product of the Day

- Expected: 200-500 signups
- Best case: 1,000+ signups
- Bonus: Press coverage

---

### 4. Open Source / GitHub

**Strategy:** Open source the core, build in public

**What to Open Source:**

- Core CRM (contacts, interactions, follow-ups)
- CLI tool
- Self-hosting instructions
- Documentation

**What Stays Closed (Initially):**

- AI features
- Cloud hosting infrastructure
- Premium features

**Benefits:**

- Builds trust with developers
- GitHub stars = social proof
- Contributors = evangelists
- SEO (GitHub ranks well)

**Promotion:**

- Share progress on Twitter
- Post on r/selfhosted, r/opensource
- Hacker News "Show HN"
- DEV.to / Hashnode articles

**Target:** 1,000 GitHub stars by month 12

---

### 5. Content Marketing

**Channels:**

- Blog (dev hub.app/blog)
- Twitter (@devhubcrm)
- DEV.to / Hashnode (syndicate)
- YouTube (screen recordings)

**Content Types:**

**Educational:**

- "How to manage developer relationships"
- "Conference networking tips"
- "GitHub profile optimization"

**Product Updates:**

- "We shipped [feature]"
- "Behind the scenes: building [feature]"
- Weekly changelog

**Case Studies:**

- "How [Developer] uses DevHub"
- "Managing 500+ developer contacts"
- "Conference ROI: tracking connections"

**SEO Keywords:**

- "developer CRM"
- "GitHub CRM"
- "conference networking tool"
- "developer relationship management"

**Goal:** 1,000 organic visits/month by month 6

---

### 6. Community Building

**Platforms:**

- Discord server (community support)
- Twitter (announcements, engagement)
- GitHub Discussions (feature requests, issues)

**Activities:**

- Weekly office hours
- Feature voting (what to build next)
- User showcases
- Beta testing program

**Why It Works:**

- Engaged users = evangelists
- Direct feedback loop
- Word of mouth amplification
- Retention boost

---

### 7. Partnerships & Integrations

**Partner With:**

- Conference organizers (promote to attendees)
- Developer communities (DEV, Hashnode, freeCodeCamp)
- Other dev tools (Zapier, n8n integrations)

**Integration Opportunities:**

- Zapier: "DevHub + Slack" workflows
- Discord: Bot for logging interactions
- Notion: Import/export contacts
- Linear: Link contacts to issues

**Win-Win:**

- Partners get value-add feature
- DevHub gets distribution

- **Total: ~$100/month**

**$500-2,000/month (Months 7-12):**

- Hosting: $100 (scale up)

**If too much growth too fast:**

- Hire support person
- Scale infrastructure
- Add waitlist
- Raise prices (slow growth)
