# Auth Patterns

## Quick Pattern

```typescript
// Login form
export const login = form(schema, async ({ email, password }) => {
	const event = getRequestEvent();
	await auth.api.signInEmail({
		body: { email, password },
		headers: event.request.headers,
	});
	redirect(303, '/dashboard'); // Outside try/catch
});

// Protected query
export const get_data = guarded_query(() => {
	return { message: 'Protected data' };
});
```

## Core Principles

- Use `getRequestEvent()` for headers (cookie access)
- Redirect MUST be outside try/catch (throws error)
- Use `guarded_query/form/command` for protected endpoints
- Email verification required before login
- Commands cannot redirect - use client-side `goto()`
