# Public Profiles & Viral Growth

## Viral Loop

Every user becomes a growth channel through their public developer
profile.

**Mechanic:**

1. User signs up â†’ gets public profile (`devhub.app/@username`)
2. Profile includes QR code for easy sharing
3. At conferences/meetups â†’ shows QR code instead of business card
4. Someone scans â†’ sees profile + "Add to Your Devhub CRM" button
5. They sign up â†’ get their own profile â†’ repeat

**Result:** Exponential growth through network effects

## Public Profile Features

- Primary: `devhub.app/@username`
- Alt: `devhub.app/scott` (vanity, Pro feature)

**QR Scan Flow:**

2. Profile page detects param â†’ shows enhanced UI
3. **If logged in:** Big "Add to My Contacts" button
4. **If not logged in:** "Sign up to save this contact" CTA
5. Scan tracked in `profile_views` table with `qr_scan = 1`

  Pro to see who's looking at your profile"
- **Pro users:** Full analytics dashboard with viewer details, QR scan
  breakdown, conversion tracking

**Tracked metrics (Free tier - aggregated only):**

- Referrer sources (Twitter, conference, direct link, etc.)
- Conversion to signup tracking
- Geographic heatmap (conferences, cities)

**Database schema:** All data stored in `profile_views` table from
day 1. Free users just can't see details until they upgrade (no data
loss).

## Growth Projections

- **Month 1:** 100 users â†’ 150 (via friend shares)
- **Month 2:** 150 â†’ 300 (2x from profiles)
- **Month 3:** 300 â†’ 750 (2.5x from conference season)
- **Month 6:** 750 â†’ 3,000+ (viral coefficient >1.5)

**Key assumption:** Each active user shares profile â†’ 2-3 signups over
6 months

## Conference Strategy

**Before:** Download printable QR cards, add QR to badge/laptop, share
profile link on conference Slack/Discord

**During:** Show QR on phone/laptop, share link in chat, add to badge

**After:** See who scanned, auto-create follow-ups, track conference
connections

## Privacy Controls

**Profile visibility:**

- Fully public (default)
- Public but unlisted (need direct link)
- Private (Devhub users only)
- Disabled (don't want public profile)

**What's shown:**

- User controls what appears
- Can hide email, phone, location
- Can disable QR code
- Can turn off analytics

## TODO: Improvements Needed

### Social Links UX

**Current state:** Clunky social links implementation on profile page

**Issues:**

- Manual platform detection with if/else blocks
- Not scalable for adding new platforms
- Hard-coded icons and labels
- No consistent styling pattern

**Proposed solution:**

- Create `SocialLinkButton.svelte` component
- Icon mapping object (platform â†’ icon component)
- Automatic icon selection based on platform
- Consistent styling with DaisyUI classes
- Support for unknown platforms (show generic link icon)

**Priority:** Medium (works but needs refactoring)

## Success Metrics

**Adoption:**

- 70% of users create public profile
- 50% share QR code at events
- 40% add profile link to Twitter/GitHub

**Conversion:**

- 60% scan-to-signup conversion
- Average 5 scans per profile per conference
- 2x signup rate during conference season

**Viral coefficient:**

- Target: >1.5 (each user brings 1.5 new users)
- Goal: Self-sustaining growth by month 6
