# Connection Insights & Advanced Features

Novel feature ideas for understanding and strengthening professional
relationships. These go beyond traditional CRM stats to provide
genuine relationship intelligence.

**Philosophy**: Help developers maintain authentic relationships by
surfacing context, patterns, and opportunities they'd naturally
remember if they had perfect memory.

## Core Stats

### 1. Memory Strength Score

**What**: Measures how much context you actually have about this
person (0-100).

**Why it's useful**: Tells you "I should learn more about this person"
vs "I know them well".

**Calculation**:

- Contact fields filled: Name (required), Company (+10), Title (+10),
  Email (+10), Phone (+10), GitHub (+10), Birthday (+10)
- Notes present: +20
- Interaction count: +5 per interaction (max 30)
- Interaction detail: Average note length (+10 if >100 chars avg)

**Display**: Progress bar or percentage with label

- 80-100: "Strong memory" (green)
- 50-79: "Good context" (blue)
- 20-49: "Basic info" (yellow)
- 0-19: "Learn more" (red)

**Tier**: Free

**Priority**: High (Phase 1)

---

### 2. Reciprocity Balance

**What**: Visual indicator showing who initiates contact.

**Why it matters**: Helps identify if relationship is mutual or
one-sided.

**Calculation**:

- Track who initiates (could be manual flag on interactions, or
  inferred from context)
- Calculate ratio: Your initiations / Total interactions

**Display**:

- üü¢ Balanced (40-60% either side)
- üü° You initiate mostly (70%+ you)
- üî¥ One-sided (90%+ you)

**Insight examples**:

- "You initiated last 5 interactions - they might not be as engaged"
- "Balanced - healthy mutual relationship"

**Tier**: Pro

**Priority**: Medium (Phase 2)

---

### 3. Topic Freshness Map

**What**: Shows aging of discussion topics with each contact.

**Why it's useful**: Surfaces conversation gaps and suggests what to
catch up on.

**Display**:

```
React: 2 weeks ago üü¢
Career: 2 months ago üü°
Personal: 6 months ago üî¥
```

**Implementation**:

- Use vector embeddings to cluster interaction notes into topics
- Track last interaction date for each topic cluster
- Color code by recency

**Insights**:

- "You only talk about work, should check in personally"
- "Haven't discussed AI in 3 months (was previously common)"

**Tier**: Pro

**Priority**: High (Phase 2 - requires vector search foundation)

---

## Context & Conversation Support

### 4. Smart Conversation Starters

**What**: Time-aware, context-rich suggestions that avoid redundancy.

**Why it's different from basic AI**: Tracks what you already asked +
considers time elapsed.

**Examples**:

- ‚úÖ "Ask about their Rust project (mentioned 3 months ago, probably
  has progress)"
- ‚úÖ "Check if they went to React Summit (said they were planning to)"
- ‚ùå "Ask about their promotion" (you just asked last week)

**Implementation**:

- Extract potential follow-up items from past notes using NLP/LLM
- Track if item was addressed in subsequent interactions
- Surface stale items (>30 days) as conversation starters
- Remove items that were recently discussed

**Tier**: Pro

**Priority**: High (Phase 2)

---

### 5. Knowledge Debt Tracker

**What**: Extracts promises and action items from your notes.

**Why it's useful**: Reminds you of commitments you made.

**Examples from notes**:

- "Asked about my project" ‚Üí Prompt to share update
- "Should grab coffee next time in SF" ‚Üí Location-based reminder

**Implementation**:

- Keyword detection: "I'll send", "remind me to", "should introduce",
  "will follow up"
- Extract commitment + create pending action
- Mark complete when done
- Nag gently if overdue

**Display**:

- Badge on contact showing open items count
- "Pending items" section on contact page
- Quick complete/dismiss actions

**Tier**: Free (basic), Pro (AI extraction)

Pending items: You said you'd intro her to Mike
Recent notes: Interested in AI, working on new project
Suggested topics:
  - Ask about React 19 adoption at Vercel

### 17. Time Since Meaningful Interaction

**What**: Distinguishes substantial conversations from quick
check-ins.

**Why it's useful**: "Last contact 2 weeks ago" might be misleading if
it was just "hey!"
